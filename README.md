## Introduction

Serilog is a powerful and flexible logging library for .NET applications. It provides a variety of sinks that allow you to send log messages to different destinations, such as files, databases, and third-party services.

This demo project serves as a hands-on guide to help you understand and use different types of sinks provided by Serilog.

## Supported Sinks

The following sinks are demonstrated in this project:

1. File Sink: Logs are written to a local file on the disk.
2. Console Sink: Logs are displayed in the console window.
3. Seq Sink: Logs are sent to a Seq server for centralized log management.
4. Application Insights Sink: Logs are sent to Microsoft Application Insights for monitoring and analysis.

Each sink has its own benefits and use cases, depending on your application's requirements.
